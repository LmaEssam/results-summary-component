This web-based application provides a results summary component, designed to visually display test scores and compare user performance against others. It features a breakdown of scores across multiple categories such as Reaction, Memory, Verbal, and Visual skills. Users can interact with their scores, and a "Continue" button facilitates navigation to subsequent sections or tests. The project employs HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a responsive and interactive user experience.
